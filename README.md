This repository is a quick how-to with the objective of making any connected speaker smarter and any dumb speaker smart.
Concretely, we are going to make any speaker compatible with Airplay 2, allowing multi-room audio (i.e., you can choose one or more speakers to play music from).
What are the use cases of this?
1. Get rid of cloud connections and unclear communication with external servers (the case of Sonos, awesome product especially the one in collaboration with Ikea, but it sucks that you have to be connected to internet to make it work)
2. Upgrade outdated connected-speakers such as the Olisten TecTecTec!, very good quality speaker but terrible software.

# Quick overview
I have designed the following steps:
- Hardware:
	- Install any HiFi hat on a Raspberry PI Zero W. I have chosen something like [this](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005005703037501.html)
	- Design and 3D print a component to physically install the Raspberry PI Zero W inside the (connected)speaker
	- Make any necessary modifications to the PCBs to connect all the three components in a professional way (the Raspberry, the HiFi hat and the (connected)speaker)
- Software
	- Install the awesome [shairport-sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) with all dependencies etc.
	- Make the Rapsberry PI Zero W read-only, in order to prevent damages to the microSD card

# Hardware
## Installing the HiFi hat
It is pretty straight forward. Depending on the level of sound quality you want, you can choose different boards. Since we will be using connected speakers (and they can be good quality, such as the outdated TecTecTec! I am using by Olisten, but they will never be outstanding) a standard HiFi hat for the raspberry does the job admirably.
I recommend to use some sort of supports to connect the hat to the raspberry, something like this (sometimes they come together with the hat): 
![Brass supports](https://github.com/giovi321/Smart-speaker/assets/6443515/cc72d36e-4659-429b-9025-eed52762fc94)

## Designing a support for the raspberry and hat
This step heavily depends on the design of your speaker and the space available inside the case.

## Connecting the audio and power of the raspberry to the connected speaker
If your're lucky enough (like me with the TecTecTec! by Olisten), you will find very conveniently:
- line-in to feed sound into the connected speaker
- 5 volt line that powers some components of the connected speaker, to which you can piggy-back the Raspberry
Shall you not find the line-in, I suggest you to google the pinout of the major components present on the PCB of the connected speaker and see which component has a line-in input.
Shall you not find a 5 volt line, just get somewhere a 5v voltage regulator such as the LM7805. It will accept currents to up to 35 volts (usually, check the specific one you are buying).

To physically connect the line-out of the RPi and the line-in of the speaker, I strongly recommend to solder a shielded cable, to prevent interferences on the line.

# Software
Premise: I assume that we are running a Raspberry Pi with a headless (we don't need the GUI) Raspberry OS based on debian-buster. I guess it would work also on other versions, but I cannot guarantee it.
You should run everything as root.

## Install shairport-sync
The source of the following is the repository of shairport-sync.

1. Install dependencies
```
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install --no-install-recommends build-essential git autoconf automake libtool libpopt-dev libconfig-dev libasound2-dev avahi-daemon libavahi-client-dev libssl-dev libsoxr-dev libplist-dev libsodium-dev libavutil-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev uuid-dev libgcrypt-dev xxd
```

2. Build and install NQPTP
Install the software using git
```
git clone https://github.com/mikebrady/nqptp.git
cd nqptp
autoreconf -fi
./configure --with-systemd-startup
make
make install
```

Enable the service unit
```
systemctl enable nqptp
systemctl start nqptp
```

Test the installation
```
systemctl status nqptp
```
Just make sure you get the green light

3. Build and install shairport-sync
Install the software using git
```
git clone https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync.git
cd shairport-sync
autoreconf -fi
./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --with-alsa --with-soxr --with-avahi --with-ssl=openssl --with-systemd --with-airplay-2
make
make install
```
Enable the service unit
```
systemctl enable shairport-sync
systemctl start shairport-sync
```
Test the service
```
systemctl status shairport-sync
```
Make sure you get the green light

4. Make the file-system read-only
We are doing this to make sure no data is written to the microSD card in order to give it long life.
The source of the following instructions is [this](https://medium.com/@andreas.schallwig/how-to-make-your-raspberry-pi-file-system-read-only-raspbian-stretch-80c0f7be7353).

- Prepare the system
```
apt remove --purge triggerhappy anacron logrotate dphys-swapfile xserver-common lightdm
apt autoremove --purge
```
- Remove some startup scripts
```
systemctl disable bootlogs
systemctl disable console-setup
```
- Replace your log manager
```
apt install busybox-syslogd
dpkg --purge rsyslog
```
- Disable swap and filesystem check and set it to read-only
```
nano /boot/cmdline.txt
```
Add the following three words at the end of the line, when you're done use ctrl+x, y, enter
```
fastboot noswap ro
```
For example, you might obtain something like this:
```
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait fastboot noswap ro
```
- Move some system files to temp filesystem
```
rm -rf /var/lib/dhcp /var/lib/dhcpcd5 /var/run /var/spool /var/lock /etc/resolv.conf
ln -s /tmp /var/lib/dhcp
ln -s /tmp /var/lib/dhcpcd5
ln -s /tmp /var/run
ln -s /tmp /var/spool
ln -s /tmp /var/lock
touch /tmp/dhcpcd.resolv.conf
ln -s /tmp/dhcpcd.resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```
- Update the systemd random seed
```
rm /var/lib/systemd/random-seed
ln -s /tmp/random-seed /var/lib/systemd/random-seed
nano /lib/systemd/system/systemd-random-seed.service
```
Add the following line under the `[Service]` section
```
ExecStartPre=/bin/echo "" >/tmp/random-seed
```
For example, you might obtain something like this:
```
[Service]Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStartPre=/bin/echo "" >/tmp/random-seed
ExecStart=/lib/systemd/systemd-random-seed load
ExecStop=/lib/systemd/systemd-random-seed save
```
- Reload the systemd service:
```
systemctl daemon-reload
```
- Make the file-systems read-only
```
nano /etc/fstab
```
Add the string `,ro` to all block devices, like so:
```
proc            /proc           proc    defaults             0       0
/dev/mmcblk0p1  /boot           vfat    defaults,ro          0       2
/dev/mmcblk0p2  /               ext4    defaults,noatime,ro  0       1
```
Add the following lines at the end of the file
```
tmpfs           /tmp            tmpfs   nosuid,nodev         0       0
tmpfs           /var/log        tmpfs   nosuid,nodev         0       0
tmpfs           /var/tmp        tmpfs   nosuid,nodev         0       0
```
Adding some fancy commands to switch between read-only and read-write modes
```
nano /etc/bash.bashrc
```
Add the following lines at the end of the file
```
set_bash_prompt() {
fs_mode=$(mount | sed -n -e "s/^\/dev\/.* on \/ .*(\(r[w|o]\).*/\1/p")
PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h${fs_mode:+($fs_mode)}\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
}
alias ro='sudo mount -o remount,ro / ; sudo mount -o remount,ro /boot'
alias rw='sudo mount -o remount,rw / ; sudo mount -o remount,rw /boot'
PROMPT_COMMAND=set_bash_prompt
```
Now let's make sure that the system goes back to read-only once you log out
```
nano /etc/bash.bash_logout
```
Add the following lines at the end of the file
```
mount -o remount,ro /
mount -o remount,ro /boot
```

5. All done! Just reboot
```
shutdown -r now
```

6. Optional extra
You might want to change the name of the device that appears when you play music from your device. You can do this as follows:
```
nano /etc/shairport-sync.conf
```
Add the following lines at the end of the file
```
general = {
  name = "Your desired stereo name";
};
```
Restart the shairport-sync service
```
service shairport-sync restart
```
